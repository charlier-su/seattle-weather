# Seattle Weather

In this project, data science will be used to understand whether it rains more in Seattle, WA or St. Louis, MO.

## Data

Two data sets, `seattle_rain.csv` and `stl_rain.csv`, will be used to look at the daily precipitation in each city from 2017 to 2022. They are from NOAA's [Climate Data Online Search](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND) tool.
